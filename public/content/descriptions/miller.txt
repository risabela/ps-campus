Designed by Charles Steadman and completed in 1834, Miller Chapel is the spiritual center of the [Princeton Theological Seminary] (stories/princeton-theological-seminary-and-slavery). Originally situated on Mercer Street, the chapel was moved to its present location in 1933.

Although technically separate institutions, there was a great deal of overlap between the seminary and the College of New Jersey. When undergraduates apprehended an abolitionist in town in 1835, they [paraded him](/stories/attempted-lynching) in front of the seminary. The following year, the College held its annual commencement in Miller Chapel. During the ceremony, Princeton student Thomas Ancrum (class of 1838) [physically assaulted](/stories/white-supremacy-at-commencement) black abolitionist minister Theodore Wright.
